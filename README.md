# Machin-learning-workshop

This repository contains the exampel codes used in a machine learning workshop. Each code is a numpy, tensorflow or keras implementation of a model. All of the notebboks are collaboratory notebooks, and can be opened. Some of the implementations are my work, but many codes are based on other tutorials or blogs. Those tutorials and blogs are referenced in the particular notebooks.
